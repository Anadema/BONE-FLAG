# Cognitive Weaponization Matrix


This work aims to compile techniques and key concepts enabling a direct and technical initial immersion into the field of information warfare.
The objective is to provide keys to understanding this domain of cognitive warfare in numerical environment. That have nothing to do with fact-checking, and even less with ideologies or modern approaches to skepticism (zététique). 

The research focus is both scientific and military, with the originality lying in making a high level of resources available, rather than engaging in mass vulgarization that hides behind influence methods.

I have no conflicts of interest, meaning I am not acting on behalf of any government, private company other than my own, or any political or ideological group. This is a passionate endeavor, and certainly a personal need, 
with the sole aim of trying to get closer to the truth—nothing more, nothing less. I make mistakes, and I learn as a result. My goal is only to share the knowledge I have gathered, not to position myself as an expert.

# Purpose

The Cognitive Warfare Matrix (CWM) is a conceptual tool designed to analyze and understand cognitive attacks, with the aim of enhancing detection and protection capabilities before these attacks deliver their payloads. Drawing inspiration from frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK in cybersecurity, the CWM maps out the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed in cognitive warfare—a domain focused on manipulating perceptions, emotions, and decision-making processes of individuals or groups. By organizing these elements into a dynamic grid, it enables the identification of early warning signs of a cognitive offensive, whether it involves targeted disinformation, exploitation of cognitive biases through social media, or the use of artificial intelligence to amplify confusion.

Unlike the DISARM framework, which primarily focuses on countering disinformation at a broader societal or systemic level, the CWM distinguishes itself by specifically aiming to empower the individual, providing them with a clear vision of the cognitive battlefield. This individualized approach allows users to better comprehend the theater of cognitive warfare, anticipate adversarial intentions, and neutralize psychological effects before they take hold. Thus, the CWM offers a proactive strategy to safeguard the mental and strategic integrity of potential targets, equipping them with the tools to resist manipulation in an increasingly complex information environment.
