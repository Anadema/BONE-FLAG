This work aims to compile techniques and key concepts enabling a direct and technical initial immersion into the field of information warfare.
The objective is to provide keys to understanding that have nothing to do with fact-checking, and even less with ideologies or modern approaches to skepticism (zététique). 

The research focus is both scientific and military, with the originality lying in making a high level of resources available, rather than engaging in mass vulgarization that hides behind influence methods.

I have no conflicts of interest, meaning I am not acting on behalf of any government, private company other than my own, or any political or ideological group. This is a passionate endeavor, and certainly a personal need, 
with the sole aim of trying to get closer to the truth—nothing more, nothing less. I make mistakes, and I learn as a result. My goal is only to share the knowledge I have gathered, not to position myself as an expert.
